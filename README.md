Sprint 1:

    index.html:
        In index.html there is an input box for new tasks, an add button, 
        and a list that fills dynamically as you add new items.

    login.html:
        The login.html displays two input boxes and a login button that 
        when clicked shows a login successful alert and redirects you to 
        index.html. Thereâ€™s no backend or database yet as this is for demonstration only.

    script.js:
        The script.js file adds a short JavaScript function so clicking the add button 
        actually appends your new task to the list.

    style.css:
        The style.css file sets up the layout and colors so that our page looks clean and readable.

Additional Info:
    More features will be included in a sprints 2-5.
